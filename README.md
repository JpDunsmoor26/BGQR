# BGQR
This project will create QR codes that students can scan to sign up for clubs at the next club fair. 

## How it works

### List of all clubs
* We need to get a list of all the clubs in the club fair
* We could get it from Mr. Millet

### Put the clubs into a program that creates a Qr code
* Each club gets a QR code that will be saved and printed out

### When someone scans it needs to bring them to a google form
* The form will ask them to put in their Email
* The information will be saved to a google sheet
