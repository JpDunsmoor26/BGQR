# BGQR
This project will create QR codes that students can scan to sign up for clubs at the next club fair. 

## How it works

### List of all clubs
* We need to get a list of all the clubs in the club fair
* We could get it from Mr. Millet

### Put the clubs into a program that creates a Qr code
* Each club gets a QR code that will be saved and printed out

### When someone scans it needs to bring them to a google form
* The form will ask them to put in their Email
* The information will be saved to a google sheet

## What we need to do
* Read list of club names from a spreadsheet or a file
  - Start with reading a file
  - Could connect to a google sheet?
    
* Create a QR code for each club
* Create a spreadsheet that saves the signups
  - Could we share the spreadsheet with club leaders?
* Create a google form that students use to signup
* Connect form to spreadsheet
* Program that creates a sheet that could be printed out with QR code
  - We could add a logo
  - Could add color
  - Could have decoration

* Share Github Username with me or ask to be developers for this repository
* Learn about CodeSpaces and set one up
* Come up with flow of how this will work (Whos going to do what)
* Create Skeleton of the code and how it will fit together
